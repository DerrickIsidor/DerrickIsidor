## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Social Network Packages}

library(GGally)
library(network)
library(sna)
library(ggplot2)

```

```{r}

# Creating a random graph with 15 nodes, 50% probability for edges between nodes
net = rgraph(15, mode = "graph", tprob = 0.5)

# Converting the graph into a network object
net = network(net, directed = FALSE)

# Assigning vertex names (node labels)
network.vertex.names(net) = letters[1:15]
```

## In R Markdown we can include plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Network, echo = FALSE}

# Visualizing the network with customized settings
ggnet2(net, node.size = 8, node.color = "black", edge.size = 1, edge.color = "grey", label = TRUE, label.size = 4, label.color = "red")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### **Reflection**

Using R Markdown to create this document was a really fun learning experience. One challenge I often face is understanding the syntax for code chunks and making sure the R code runs correctly when the document is compiled. However, I found that R Markdownâ€™s integration with RStudio made this much easier. It allowed me to run code chunks as I worked on the documentation, which was incredibly helpful. I also really enjoyed being able to run smaller pieces of code at a time to analyze the results. Overall, this assignment was a great way to get more comfortable using R Markdown.
